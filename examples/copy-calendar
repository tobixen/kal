## To copy a full calendar (i.e. for migration, backup or whatever):

## CAVEAT!  Some calendar server (Zimbra!) will export calendar items as scheduling objects, and when copying the items back to the calendar it will send out emails!  I managed to send out hundreds of calendar invites, rejections etc for events ten years back in time before figuring out!

plann select print-ical | plann --config-section new-calendar add ical

## * "plann select" without any options will select everything on the default calendar.
## * "print-ical" will print all this to STDOUT in ical format
## * "plann --config-section new-calendar" will connect to the new calendar, if $HOME/.config/calendar.conf is properly populated
